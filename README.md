# Overview

This project was an attempt at learning how to use the Godot Game Engine in game development as well as using GDScript to write code.

This game is currently a concept game made in 24 hours. You play as a knight stranded on an island, trying to get back to your kingdom. There are currently no enemies, but the goal would be to survive waves of enemies day and night as you cut down trees to build wood for a boat to row closer and closer home.

# Development Environment

Godot Engine v4.2.2

GDScript
